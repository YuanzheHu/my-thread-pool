# My Thread Pool

## Overview
This project implements a simple thread pool in C++ using modern C++11 features. The thread pool allows for the creation of a fixed number of worker threads that can execute tasks concurrently.

## Build Instructions
1. Install CMake (version 3.10 or higher).
2. Create a `build` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Running Tests
After building the project, you can run the test executables located in the `build/test/` directory:
```bash
./test_day1_basic
```
